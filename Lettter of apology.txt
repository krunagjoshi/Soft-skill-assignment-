Dear Dhruv,


	I hope you're doing well.

I am writing to sincerely apologize for my work late. I realize that my actions might have caused you inconvenience, and for that, I am truly sorry.

Looking back, I understand how my behavior might have made things difficult, and I deeply regret not handling the situation better. Please know that it was never my intention to upset or hurt you in any way. I take full responsibility for what happened, and I am committed to ensuring that it doesn't happen again in the future.


	I value our relationship and would like to make things right. If there's anything I can do to resolve the issue or improve things, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Once again, I apologize for any stress or discomfort I may have caused you, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.



Thank you for your understanding.



Best regards,

Krunal Joshi
