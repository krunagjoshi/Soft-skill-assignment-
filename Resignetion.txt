	Subject: Resignation from My Position


Dear Dhruv,


	
	I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to formally resign from my position at tops tech, 

After careful consideration, I have decided to take this step due to personal reasons and the need to pursue new opportunities. This was not an easy decision, as I have truly enjoyed working with you and the team. I have learned a lot during my time here and am grateful for the support and guidance you have provided.
	

I want to thank you for the opportunity to be a part of the team. I have great respect for the work you do, and I will always appreciate the experience I gained while working with you. I hope we can stay in touch, and I look forward to any future possibilities of working together again.

Please let me know how I can assist during the transition period.


Thank you once again for everything. I wish you and the team continued success.



Best regards,

Krunal Joshi
