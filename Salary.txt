	Subject: Request for Salary Increase


Dear Dhruv,


	.

I am writing to kindly request a review of my current salary. Over the past 3 mounths, I have worked hard to contribute to the team and ensure that my tasks are completed efficiently and to the best of my ability. I believe my performance has consistently met the expectations of the role, and I have taken on additional responsibilities that have helped the team achieve its goals.


	Considering my contributions, and after researching the current industry standards for my position, I feel that a salary adjustment would reflect the value I bring to the company. I am confident that this change will motivate me even more to continue working hard and delivering results.

	
I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your earliest convenience. I value my role here and look forward to continuing to grow with the team.


Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your time and attention.




Best regards,

Krunal Joshi
